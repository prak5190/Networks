## TCP Server

- Persistent connections ??
- Implement a 404 mechanism  - Dome
- Make port and file dir configurable - Port is configurable
- Currently tested with browser only - need to check out the client 


## UDP Server

- Client and server need to talk to each other - They do
- Add something to "make" for that - ok
- Client needs to record number of bytes it recieves 
- Server should indicate when last byte of file has been transmitted
