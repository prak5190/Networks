<h2>Reliable UDP</h2>

<h4>Name : Prakash Rajagopal</h4>

<h4>Usage :</h4>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>make scl</code> on silo and <code>make</code> to create app</li>
<li>Run a <code>./app</code> with port as argument. This is the receiver listening on the named port
<code>app -r 9000</code>
The received file is saved with name <code>temp</code></li>
<li>Run another <code>./app</code> with filename, destination ip and port. This is the sender which sends the file to the receiver
<code>app -s file localhost 9000</code>
The file will be found in the <code>www</code> directory  </li>
<li>Examples can be found in the makefile</li>
</ul>

<h4>Header structure :</h4>

<ul>
<li>Present in <code>header.cpp</code></li>
<li>Sequence number</li>
<li>Ack represents message type and is an 16bit integer represented as an enum in the program. In the enum if it starts with R then message is transmitted to receiver and if it starts with S then it is for the sender.
<ul>
<li>RhasFileInfo    - Represents that packet has file information</li>
<li>RData           - Represent normal data message </li>
<li>ShasFileInfo    - A file info ack for the sender, sender starts transmitting message</li>
<li>SduplicateAck   - Duplicate ack, Go back N and repeat</li>
<li>SrepeatAck      - A repeat ack to indicate that reciever has already got the packet and ensure there is no wait lock at sender side</li>
<li>SsuccessAck     - Normal success ack</li>
<li>SwrapSequence   - Ack to indicate wrap sequnce , the sequence number is used as the new base. The number is set as lastAcked and sequence base and all numbers start from 0</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps :</h4>

<p>Present in <code>udphandler.cpp</code> , where sender functions start with <code>send</code> and all handler functions for getting messages for both reciever and sender are named as <code>handler</code> functions</p>

<pre><code>R: Initially Receiver starts up to listen on named port and receive file
S: Sender starts and first sends fileInfo -&gt; Name and Size 
R: Receiver receives and sends ack
S: Sender waits for an Ack from receiver before proceeding - This is not part of the transfer
    - This request gives the sender an idea of the RTT
S: Sender starts sending file chunks on receiving ack until window fills up which initially is : Window_Size = 1 
    - In each case the RTT is updated whenever a successful ack is received
R: Receiver receives the packet and sends an  ack with header.seq as 1 + last_recieved_seq
S: Sender recieves ack and increases window size

R: In case of out of order packet with seq &gt; lastReceived + 1 , then duplicate ack is set
 : If seq &lt;= lastReceived + 1 then repeating ack is set to ensure that the previous ack was not lost
 : If timeout occurs then duplicate ack is sent similar to out of order packet
 : If seq = lastReceived + 1 , then it is a success . Sends a SsuccessAck.

S: If ack is a duplicate ack then treat it as drop and use congestion control. Sequence reset to lastRecievedAck + 1    
 : If ack seq &gt; lastRecievedAck , then lastRecievedAck = seq - 1. Is a success case , reduce window and resume any waiting threads
 : If ack has seq &lt; lastRecievedAck ,i.e ack is Srepeatack then it is just ignored

R: When received bytes = fileSize , then reciever sends a final ack, waits for seq+1 msg from sender and exits
S: When it receives a seq &gt; max_sequence possible then it sends out ack with seq+1 and exits
 : The final steps can be replaced with a special ack message to complete
</code></pre>

<h4>Adaptive retransmission - Jacobson/Karels algo</h4>

<p>Timer util methods and jacob karnels is implemented in <code>timeutil.cpp</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Initially the sender gets an estimated RTT when it sends file info and gets an ack back</li>
<li>Each succesful receive and send is used to calcualte RTT - since packets always arrive in order, This is done using jacob karnels</li>
<li>The RTT is displayed for each change</li>
</ul>

<h4>Congestion control</h4>

<ul>
<li>Slow start initially</li>
<li>On each succesful ack the window size is increased by that number</li>
<li>When a duplicate ack or timeout occurs then we make window size as 1 and make thread wait until it gets acks and window size reduces to 1</li>
<li>Then we increase window size in same way per ack until it reaches <code>window_size = congestion_window_size/2</code></li>
<li>On reaching this stage , the app enters AIMD phase - where each ack leads to increase by 1</li>
<li>Whenever there is a duplicate ack or whenever there is a timeout for an ack at the sender side then the window size is halved.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Simulate loss and delay</h4>

<ul>
<li>Drop probability set in app in combinations with <code>srandom(clock())</code> and <code>random()</code> is used to drop packets whenever enabled</li>
<li>Latency set using <code>srandom(clock())</code> in combination with latency time set in config which is used to make the listener thread (on both receiever and sender) </li>
<li>Latency using <code>usleep</code> with time as <code>(randomnumbr % 10) * 0.1 * latencyTime</code></li>
</ul>

<h4>State handling and config</h4>

<p>All of the state variables are declared in <code>state.cpp</code></p>

<ul>
<li>All the global app config is present in <code>initApp</code> function </li>
<li>The current state of each operations is stored in <code>senderState</code> and <code>recieverState</code>. This struct also holds RTT , window counter , max size , e.t.c</li>
<li>This struct also encapsulates the mutex and methods for <code>thread_wait</code> , <code>thread_resume</code> and <code>thread_timedwait</code></li>
</ul>
